#GenAI App -> Gemini Vision : Health Management App

Sample Use Cases:

Users can upload any food image and the app can:
"Identify food items"
"Calculate approx. calories for food image"
"Provide nutritional breakdown of the meal"
"Assess if the food is healthy or not"

🚀 Unlocking the Power of Generative AI with Google Gemini and Streamlit! 🚀

I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve developed an AI-powered web app that blends the capabilities of Google Gemini’s Vision Model with Streamlit to provide interactive nutritional analysis of food images! 🍎🥗

🎯 Key Features:

Technologies Used: Streamlit for the frontend, and Google Gemini's Vision Model (1.5 Pro) for AI-powered image and content generation.

Image & Text Input: Users upload images of food (jpg, jpeg, png) and click submit to generate insightful responses.

Smart Nutritional Breakdown: The model interprets the image to identify food items, estimate calories, and provide a breakdown of carbs, fats, fibers, and more!

How it Works:
Upload an image of a meal.

The app has inbuilt input prompt which is passed to the Google Gemini API, which processes the image and generates a detailed nutritional analysis, including calorie estimates and health assessments!

Why this Matters: This project demonstrates the incredible potential of Generative AI models like Google Gemini in providing smart, interactive solutions in the health space. It’s a step towards making AI-driven nutritional analysis accessible to everyone while pushing the boundaries of image understanding and natural language processing. 🌐💡
